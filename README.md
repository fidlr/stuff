Stuff
=====

This repository is used for random snippets of code that I wanted to save for later reference. It will aggregate a bunch of trial projects that I used to test out different features of random libraries I worked with.

The Projects
------------

 * ***cmdline-parser:*** A small java app that's the base for a command line utility. It's pom.xml references commons-cli for parsing the command line, and maven-assembly-plugin to package everything into a single runnable jar.

 * ***get-hotels.py:*** Python script for scraping Expedia and retrieving hotel information.
